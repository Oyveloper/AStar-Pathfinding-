# Pathfinding using the A\* algorithm

This is an implementation of the A\* algorithm used to find the
shortest path between two points on a 2D grid with walls.
The project is a part of the Introduction to AI course at NTNU

## Running the example

```bash
$ python3 -m venv env
$ source env/bin/activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ python3 pathFinding.py 1
```

The `pathFinding.py` script can be run with any number in the range [1, 4]
